The purpose of the Minnesota West Coast Swing Dance Club since the Club’s inception on March 21, 1982 has been to preserve, promote, and expand West Coast Swing Dancing. The Club was informally operated that first year by a committee. They danced in various places, i.e., Capp Towers, O’Gara’s, Good Templar Hall, Kellogg Square, Radisson Hotel and others. A dance was held about once every six weeks.

On June 6, 1983 an organizational meeting was held, a proposed charter was discussed and accepted and officers elected. The first dance at our current home, the B-Dale Club in Roseville, was held in January of 1984. Articles of incorporation were filed with the State of Minnesota in November, 1986.

Many of the Club’s activities are traditions started by early members and Club officers. We currently have two dances each month, the 2nd and 4th Friday, with a dance lesson by local instructors and music supplied by various DJs. Also included free at each dance are desserts and coffee. We have an anniversary dinner dance, special holiday dance party, picnic, and sponsor WCS workshops with nationally known instructors. All skill levels are welcome.
