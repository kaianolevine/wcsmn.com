The Twin Cities Rebels is a not-for-profit swing dance organization. Our mission is to provide a fun, friendly, energetic, and supportive community where members and guests can share a love for dance, with a primary focus on West Coast Swing. We hold regular dances and classes, as well as special weekend events where we bring in national and international stars for workshops & private lessons.
Rebels dances are held on the 1st and 3rd Sundays of every month from 8-11pm.  We offer lessons on Sundays 3 times a month from 5-7pm (except August).  These usually are a progressive series focusing on foundational aspects & patterns of West Coast Swing, but sometimes cover more advanced topics or other dances.
We hold our dances, lessons and events at:
Triune Masonic Temple
1898 Iglehart Ave. S.
St. Paul, MN 55104
