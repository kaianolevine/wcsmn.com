Welcome! This page answers common questions about how this site works and how you can contribute. This project is community-driven, and everyone is welcome to help improve the accuracy and usefulness of the information shared here.

### "How can I contribute?"

There are several ways to help, and all of them are appreciated — whether you’re technical or not:

- Submit updates, corrections, or new event information using the [contact page](/contact/index.html).
- Report anything that looks incorrect, outdated, or missing.
- If you are comfortable with web development, you can contribute directly through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kaianolevine/wcsmn.com) by submitting pull requests.

This is a community-driven project, and even small contributions help keep the information accurate and useful for everyone.


### "What does 'open source' mean?"

If you are familiar with web development, you are welcome to make direct edits to the website and submit them for review and release. Contributions typically happen through GitHub pull requests, which allows changes to be reviewed before going live.

### "What if I don't know how to edit websites?"

No problem! We are adding formal pages and processes that allow individuals to submit requests for changes or updates without needing any technical experience. You can use the contact forms to suggest edits, add events, or request corrections.

### "What if I see an issue or something incorrectly labeled on the website, even if I don't run any of the dances?"

That’s absolutely okay. This is a community resource, and the more people who help improve the accuracy of the information, the more useful it becomes for everyone. If you notice something that looks incorrect, please let us know — even small fixes make a big difference.
