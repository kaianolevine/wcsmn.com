Leadership Team
Isabella Armour (they/them)- Isabella has been a member of the MN WCS scene since August 2017 and founded the MN Swing Safety System in Summer 2024. Isabella has a background in teaching and community organization within the local ballroom dance and west coast swing communities. They are a certified, trauma-informed life coach and are passionate about creating space for all members of the dance community to feel heard and supported. Fun fact: Isabella plays the clarinet!
Jess Skjonsby, MPH (she/her) - Jess has been involved in the MN WCS scene since February 2023, joining the MN Swing Safety Leadership team in Fall 2024. She has a background in conflict resolution, crisis response, and de-escalation practices through her previous experience serving as an Area Coordinator in the Residence Life department at St. Catherine University. Jess is passionate about developing ways to grow the MN WCS community, as well as share resources with others looking to create safety systems within their own communities. Fun Fact: Jess has never eaten at Taco Bell!
Sam Robertson (they/them)- Sam has been a member of the MN WCS community since February 2024, and a member of the MN Swing Safety Leadership team since Fall 2024. Sam brings their background in resource connection, safety planning, de-escalation, and interpersonal communication (developed through their work with domestic violence victim-survivors in the metro area and doing street outreach in St Paul) to the table. It’s important to Sam to make the west coast swing dance community as safe a space as possible, because we can’t have a good time together if we don’t feel safe together. Fun fact: Sam has been an avid crocheter for 16 years (since 2009ish) and picked up knitting in 2024!
Taylor Daiello BSN, RN, RAC-CT (she/her) - Taylor has been a member of the MN WCS community since October 2024 and has been part of the MN Swing Safety Leadership team since Spring 2025.  She is passionate about building a community that is welcoming and safe to everybody, and believes that in order to build a restorative and just culture we must first acknowledge the power and privilege afforded (or not) to each of us by patriarchal white supremacy. Her background in Emergency nursing and Nursing Education (2013-2024), co-creating and delivering anti-racism education (Minnesota Nurses Association Racial Diversity Committee, 2022-2023), and community/union organizing (various, 2017- present) have given her a wealth of knowledge and experience with conflict resolution, de-escalation, advocacy, large incident response, and training/education facilitation.  Beyond all the fancy words, she wants to build a community where every person is seen for and accepted as who they are, and can joyfully move their body in a safe space.
Fun Fact:  Taylor once helped get a live bug out of somebody’s ear!
